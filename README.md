# Biodiversity Intactness Index change in Phoenix subdivision

## About
This repository contains a notebook `phoenix-biodiversity-change.ipynb` analyzing data about biodiversity index (BII) change from 2017 to 2020 in the Phoenix subdivision in Arizona, US.

## Visualization
After examining geospatial datasets, a BII change map from 2017 to 2020 is created. This map is located in the images directory.

## Highlights
- Access data from the Microsoft planetary computer
- Geospatial data wrangling using `rioxarray`
- Customizing a map using `matplotlib`

## Data

### BII data:

 The first dataset is part of the Microsoft Planetary Computer (MPC) STAC catalog. The dataset is generated by [Impact Observatory](https://www.impactobservatory.com/), in collaboration with [Vizzuality](https://www.vizzuality.com/), these datasets estimate terrestrial Biodiversity Intactness as 100-meter gridded maps for the years 2017-2020. For this analysis we will use the data assets for the 2020 and 2017 Biodiversity Intactness surveys.


### Phoenix subdivision data

The second dataset used will be polygons of subdivisions in Arizona, United States. This dataset has been downloaded as a shapefile from the Phoenix subdivision polygon in the Census County Subdivision shapefiles for Arizona from the [TIGER shapefiles](https://www.census.gov/cgi-bin/geo/shapefiles/index.php?year=2022&layergroup=County+Subdivisions).
